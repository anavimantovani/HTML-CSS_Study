        <h2>Gingerbread Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          If you've never made homemade gingerbread cookies, your holiday season is about to change. These classic Christmas treats are often made just because they're the pinnacle of festive cuteness. <br>But, we think these Christmas cookies are pretty delicious too. Soft and full of warm spice, these cookies are the perfect way to ring in the season.

        <h3>Step #1:</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat butter, brown sugar, and molasses until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until combined.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step #2:</h3>
        <p>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, spices, baking soda, and salt until combined. With the mixer on low, gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, as well as  fresh ginger, orange zest, and black pepper (if using), until dough just comes together. (Do not overmix!)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step #3:</h3>
        <p>Divide dough in half and create two discs. Wrap each in plastic wrap and chill until firm, about 2 to 3 hours. (Alternatively, divide dough in half and roll each piece of dough between two pieces of parchment to 1/4" thick. Chill until firm.)</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step #4:</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350Â° and line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Place one disc of dough on a lightly floured surface and roll until 1/4" thick. (Alternatively, peel off both sheets of parchment from dough, then replace one sheet of parchment back underneath dough.) Cut out gingerbread men with a 3" wide cutter and transfer to baking sheets.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step #5:</h3>
        <p>Bake until slightly puffed and set, 9 to 10 minutes, depending on the size of your cookie cutters. Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a cooling rack to cool completely. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Step #6:</h3>
        <p>Repeat with remaining disc of dough. Decorate with icing and sprinkles as desired.</p>
