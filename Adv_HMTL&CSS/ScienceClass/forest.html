    <h2>What is a forest?</h2>

    <p>A forest is a complex, constantly changing environment made up of a variety of living things, such as trees, shrubs, wildflowers, ferns, mosses, and wildlife. Trees are the dominant feature of a forest. Over 30% of the Earth&#39;s surface is covered with forests.</p>

    <p>We live in the temperate deciduous forest biome, which is defined by its four distinct seasons: winter, spring, summer, and fall. In the deciduous forest, the leaves on the trees change color in the fall, lose their leaves at the end of the each growing season, and grow back in the spring. The word deciduous comes from a Latin word that meant to fall down or off.</p>

    <p>The animals that live in deciduous forests have also adapted to these yearly changes. Animals adjust to the cold winters by hibernating, migrating, or keeping active all winter.</p>

    <h2>Why are forests important?</h2>

    <p>Individually, trees provide shade and relief from the hot sun. Forests are important for the survival of wildlife. Forests also absorb carbon dioxide and replenish the atmosphere with oxygen for us to breathe in a process called photosynthesis. </p>

    <h2>The Deciduous Forest</h2>

    <p>Maple - There are over 200 different species of maple trees. Maple syrup comes from Sugar Maples, which produce a higher concentration of sugars than other maples. Maple tree seeds are recognizable as they fall to the ground in a spinning helicopter-like motion.</p>

    <p>Oak - Oak trees can live for over 200 years. The largest Oak tree is one named "The Seven Sisters Oak" in Lousiana -- it measures 37 feet and 2 inches around and is estimated to be more than 1,000 years old! A single Oak tree can produce thousands of acorns every fall.</p>
