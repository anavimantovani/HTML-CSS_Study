<h1>Seasonal Gardening Checklist</h1> 

<ul><p>Fall – The time to plant trees and spring-blooming bulbs. Take the time to clean the leaves and dead foliage from your beds and lawn.<br></p>
<p>Winter – The time to prune fruit trees and finish planting your bulbs. Don’t forget to water young trees when the ground is dry.<br></p>
<p>Spring – The time to prepare your beds, plant annuals, and apply fertilizer to established plants. Remember to mulch to maintain moisture and prevent weed growth.<br></p>
<p>Summer – The time to supplement rainfall so that plants get one inch of water per week. Plant your vegetable garden and enjoy bountiful harvests until late fall.<br></p></ul>

<h1>Basic Gardening Tips</h1> 

<ol><p>Select plants according to your climate.<br></p>
<p>In planning your garden, consider the composition, texture, structure, depth, and drainage of your soil. <br></p>
<p>Use compost to improve the structure of your soil. <br></p>
<p>Choose plant foods based on your garden objectives. <br></p>
<p>Generally, plants should receive one inch of water per week. <br></p>
<p>Use mulch to conserve moisture, keep plants cool, and cut down on weeding.<br>
